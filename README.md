# DataProduct1
This contains the first data product from the data products class
The project is a modification of the tutorial on stockVis
showing how to use reactivity in data product apps.
I extend the features of this application by adding more graphing 
capabilities.
I have also starting on changing the user interface to allow histograms
of the price returns but I have only finished the input not the output stage.

That's all for now how you enjoy!
